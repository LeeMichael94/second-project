MEAN Stack Angular Typescript Project

Quick Start
Install node.js 

Using the Angular Typescript, instantly fetch the latest npm published package (or any version available on npm) with npx, npm init or yarn create without having to install any dependencies. Running the following npx command installs the latest version into a folder called new-site

npx create-Angular new-site
cd new-site
npm install
npm run start
Using our new Template Repository create a new GitHub repository based on the latest code from the main branch of Angular.


Check the default configuration from Browserslist for more details on browsers and versions covered.
